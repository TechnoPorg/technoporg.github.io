#### Hi! I'm Jonah, a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦/ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª software developer studying at the University of Waterloo.

I've worked on developing several different websites, including a web application for the Alberta Natural Resources Conservation Board, but my true passions are operating systems, game development, and quantum computing.

I love free and open-source software, and I contribute to it whenever I'm able.

My current project is a Rust utility to simplify partition management for Linux beginners.

Apart from that, although I love the code that makes our world tick, it's far from being my only subject of interest.

For as long as I can remember, I've had a love for languages, and in order of ability, I speak - or am learning - English, French, German, and Mandarin. I also competed at the 2024 International Linguistics Olympiad in BrasÃ­lia, Brazil; it was a magical experience, and I know that I'll be back as a volunteer someday!

I also love reading, cycling, fiddling, playing (or making!) the odd video game, and baking.
